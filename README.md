# Bockchain_java_implementation
Introduction   This project is an implementation of the blockchain technology in java, In this project I am to recreate all the major feature of block chain using java.    *** distributed ledger  not implemented KEY TERMS USED  Blockchain   Is a chain of blocks that store information. It is a distributed ledger that is completely open to anyone once some data has been recorded inside a blockchain it becomes very difficult to change it.  Block  Each block contains three parts data, hash, hash of previous block.  Hash It identifies a block and all of its contents it is unique for each block. Data It depends on what the block chain is used for. Previous hash  It is the hash of previous block.  **Hash is calculated using everything inside the block once something is changed inside  a blockchain it              also causes the hash to change. ** Hash are very usefull to detect changes to a block.  Proof of work Is a mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks.
